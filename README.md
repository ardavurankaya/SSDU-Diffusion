# ZS-SSL-Diffusion

Code for the abstract "Self-Supervised Deep Learning Reconstruction for Highly Accelerated Diffusion Imaging", which was presented at 2023 ISMRM Annual Meeting at Toronto.
ZS-SSL-Diffusion extends the ZS-SSL framework introduced by Yaman et.al. to multi-shot sensitivity encoded diffusion MRI, enabling high reconstruction quality at 
high acceleration rates.
Training and reconstruction can be performed by running the main.py file.
